# API Configuration

# For Development (using Vite)
# Vite environment variables must be prefixed with VITE_
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api

# For Docker/Production Deployment
# This is used at container startup to generate config.js
# No VITE_ prefix needed as it's not used by Vite build process
